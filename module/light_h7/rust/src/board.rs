//! Board wiring for the WeAct MiniSTM32H7xx (STM32H743VIT6): an on-board 0.96" ST7735S panel,
//! 160x80 in the landscape it is mounted in, on SPI4; one user key; one LED. Pins all
//! hardware-verified on this board.
//!
//! This lives with the APPLICATION, not in the port crate: `light-stm32h7` knows the chip and
//! nothing about which WeAct board it sits on.
