//! The LANDSCAPE dictaphone executable for the Waveshare RP2350-Touch-LCD-3.49. All the board
//! wiring, the modules and the runtime are shared with the portrait build in
//! `light_dictaphone_touch349`; this crate contributes only what the two orientations differ by --
//! the embedded blobs (font, theme, and `light_app_dictaphone_wide/design.json` as an LUI blob) and
//! the landscape [`RunConfig`] -- plus the `#[no_mangle]`/`#[panic_handler]` entry points the shell
//! ABI requires. It starts sideways (R270) and follows the device between the two landscape poses.
