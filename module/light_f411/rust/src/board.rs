//! Board wiring for the WeAct Blackpill (STM32F411CEU6): a LED on PC13 and a key on PA0, both
//! active low -- per the board's documentation. Nothing here has read the key yet, so its
//! sense is the documentation's word until hardware says otherwise (the H7's turned
//! out inverted).
//!
//! This lives with the APPLICATION, not in the port crate: `light-stm32f4` knows the chip and
//! nothing about which board it sits on.
