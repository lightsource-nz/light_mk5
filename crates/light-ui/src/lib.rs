//! The widget toolkit, ported from the predecessor C framework.
//!
//! A retained tree of windows, buttons and labels over the frame layer. The tree is built from
//! `const` descriptors that live in flash; navigating tears the current page down and builds
//! the next, so only one page's widgets exist at a time. Widgets live in a fixed arena owned by
//! the [`Ui`] -- no allocator, and a tree too big for it is a build error at the call that adds
//! the widget, never a silent drop.
//!
//! **What comes out is an event, not a callback.** The predecessor's buttons carried a C
//! function pointer, a `void *` and a command string; here a button carries what it *emits*
//! -- a value of the application's own event type -- and, optionally, where it navigates.
//! Activation returns the emitted value for the caller to publish on its bus, which is the
//! "command tree is the event bus" decision applied to the UI: a tap, a console line and a
//! boot script all end up as the same event, and a handler runs on its own module's poll
//! rather than inside the input path.
//!
//! **Hardware-free**, as its predecessor was: nothing here knows what a touch controller, a
//! push button or an IMU is. The application maps its devices onto the input calls (a few
//! lines per app), and the toolkit can be exercised entirely on the host.
//!
//! Coordinates: every widget rect is in ABSOLUTE logical canvas coordinates, never
//! parent-relative, so a hit test, a clip and an invalidation are the same arithmetic wherever a
//! widget sits. Input arrives in PANEL coordinates -- what a touch controller reports -- and is
//! untransformed here, because the toolkit is the one thing that knows the rotation.
