//! Board wiring for the Waveshare RP2350-Touch-LCD-2.8: pins from the board's official
//! schematic, cross-checked against two independent open-source drivers for this exact board
//! -- the same paper trail the 1.69's pinout had before ITS bring-up. This wiring is
//! build-verified only; it has not yet met hardware.
//!
//! This lives with the APPLICATION, not in the port crate: `light-rp2` knows the chip and
//! nothing about what anyone soldered to it.
