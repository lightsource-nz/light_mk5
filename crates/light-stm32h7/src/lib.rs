//! STM32H743 chip access for the light framework, on bare CMSIS: the port behind
//! `light_core::hal`, and the counterpart of `light-rp2`. Board wiring -- which pins carry
//! what on whichever board the chip sits on -- lives with the application, not here.
//!
//! The C shell (`module/light_mk4_shell_cmsis`) owns what a chip port owns: the CMSIS
//! startup file and linker script, the clock tree (400 MHz off the crystal, with PLL1's Q output
//! for the SPI kernel clock and PLL3 at 48 MHz for USB), the caches, and the console -- ITM and
//! USART1 both, since they fail in opposite ways. This crate owns the peripherals the drivers
//! talk to, through the registers directly. The finding that matters most is carried in
//! [`spi::Spi4Display`]: the H7's SPI is a different generation from the F4's, with a transfer
//! size programmed per transaction and a FIFO to prime before the start.
//!
//! No pac: the handful of registers this port touches are written against the reference
//! manual, as its C predecessor was, which keeps the crate small and its failures legible.
