//! Board wiring for the Waveshare RP2350-Touch-LCD-3.49: pins from the board's reference
//! demo (`DEV_Config.h` + `qspi_pio.h`), which is the closest thing to a schematic
//! transcription on hand -- the same provenance discipline as the 2.8's wiring.
//! HARDWARE-VERIFIED 2026-08-31: panel, touch (axes measured on the glass), backlight
//! inversion, IMU axis map -- the bring-up checklist is complete.
//!
//! An RP2350B: 48 GPIOs, and this board actually uses the upper bank -- the touch bus, the
//! backlight and the battery pins all live above 31, which is what grew `light-rp2`'s
//! hi-bank support.
