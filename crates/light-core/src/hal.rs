//! The port interface: what portable code asks of a board, and nothing more.
//!
//! Designed from the list of primitives portable code actually uses rather than from what a HAL
//! happens to offer. The predecessor C framework's port surface grew to 4,500 lines across ten
//! port modules; this is the whole of it, and a port crate implements each trait once. The one primitive not here is
//! the critical section, which is the `critical-section` crate's `Impl`, supplied by the port.
