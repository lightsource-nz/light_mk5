//! Portable core of the light framework, mk4: the runtime and what every other crate needs
//! from it. The port interface ([`hal`]), the module runtime, the bounded log queue, the typed
//! event bus and the mailbox, a line reader for consoles, and the two hal-level helpers small
//! enough to live here (a blinker, a debounced button).
//!
//! Nothing in this crate touches hardware. Everything it needs from the world comes through the
//! traits in [`hal`], which a port crate implements, plus one `critical_section` implementation
//! from the port -- which is what lets the same code run under `cargo test` on the host with a
//! mocked board. The host-first rule the predecessor C framework had, made structural.
//!
//! The rest of the framework is layered above: `light-draw` (the rasteriser), `light-display`
//! (the chunked display core, the frame layer and the panel drivers), `light-input` (touch,
//! gestures, the IMU), `light-ui` (the widget toolkit) and `light-midi` (the USB-MIDI
//! forwarder engine). Each depends on this crate; none depends on a port.
