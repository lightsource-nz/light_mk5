//! The `critical_section` implementation for RP2350: interrupts off on this core AND a hardware
//! spinlock held against the other core.
//!
//! This is the primitive the predecessor C framework had three divergent versions of (lock-free CAS on host, pico-sdk
//! `critical_section_t` on RP2, a saved PRIMASK on STM32 that was silently not re-entrant).
//! Here there is exactly one, the portable code sees only `critical_section::with`, and nesting
//! is handled: a section entered while interrupts are already disabled is treated as nested and
//! does not touch the spinlock, which is what makes it safe to call from inside another section
//! -- the case the STM32 port's contract forbade in a comment.
//!
//! Spinlock 31 is the one pico-sdk and rp2040-hal leave for exactly this purpose; the SDK's own
//! `critical_section_t` uses claimed locks from the striped range, so the two never contend for
//! the same lock -- they simply do not protect each other's data, which is the expected split
//! while the shell and the Rust side own separate state.
//!
//! The chip has two ISAs and this file serves both: the interrupt mask is PRIMASK on the
//! Cortex-M33 pair and `mstatus.MIE` on the Hazard3 pair; the spinlock is the same SIO register
//! either way. The bootrom leaves lock 31 free on both, and the debugger reading it acquires it
//! on both -- write 1 to release.
