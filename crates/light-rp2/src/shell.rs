//! The Rust side of the shell ABI: the small helpers every RP2 firmware layers on the C shell's
//! `light_shell_*` symbols. The C shell (pico-sdk) hands the Rust staticlib its resolved clocks,
//! drains its logs and console input on core 1, and takes its panic message -- and that handshake
//! is the same for every board on this port, so it lives here rather than in each board's support
//! crate. A board's instantiation crate keeps only the thin `#[no_mangle] light_app_core1_service`
//! and `#[panic_handler]` wrappers that call in.
