//! The USB-MIDI host transport: TinyUSB's `tuh_midi_*` API behind [`light_midi::Transport`],
//! and the class callbacks the stack expects the application to define.
//!
//! Everything here runs on core 0, in the context the shell's `light_shell_usb_host_task()` is
//! called from: the stack's mount callbacks fire from inside `tuh_task()`, so they arrive on the
//! same core as the packet reads and go through a mailbox only to get out of the callback and
//! into the module's own poll -- keeping the rule that a callback the stack is still unwinding
//! does no work of its own.
//!
//! Only meaningful in a firmware whose shell was built for the host role; the symbols resolve
//! against `tinyusb_host` at link time.
