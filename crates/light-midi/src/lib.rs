//! USB-MIDI forwarding: the forwarder engine, ported from the predecessor C framework.
//!
//! One rule: incoming data on cable C of any mounted device is forwarded to cable C of
//! every other mounted device that has a cable C. Devices are slots indexed the way the host
//! stack indexes its MIDI interfaces; what sits behind a slot -- TinyUSB, an SPI-linked peer
//! board, a test mock -- is a [`Transport`], and the engine sees only 4-byte USB-MIDI event
//! packets, a fixed-size self-framing format every transport shares without any MIDI parsing
//! of its own.
//!
//! Hub mode is position: the host stack's mount index says nothing about which socket a cable
//! is in and is not even stable across a reconnect, so a device also records the hub port it
//! arrived on, which is the physical identity a status display can show.
//!
//! The engine holds no clock and calls nothing back: mounts and unmounts come in as calls,
//! traffic goes through the transport, and what an application must react to -- a display to
//! update, a host controller to reset -- comes out as return values.
