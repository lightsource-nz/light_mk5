//! The framework's power behaviour, once, as portable policy: the screen dims after a spell of no
//! activity, and -- on battery, never on external power -- the board powers itself off after a
//! longer idle. The policy is the timers and the state machine; everything a particular board can
//! actually *do* -- drive its backlight, tell whether it is on external power, cut its own power,
//! read its battery, read its power button -- is a [`PowerMechanism`] the port supplies.
//!
//! A port that has something to manage builds a [`PowerManager`] over its mechanism and a
//! [`Clock`], drives it from its board module (activity in, backlight commands in, a busy flag
//! while long work runs), and reads a [`Poll`] out that says when to shut down. A port with no
//! battery or backlight simply does not use this -- or supplies a mechanism whose methods are the
//! trivial defaults.
//!
//! **Levels are per-mille**: `0..=1000`, where 0 is off and 1000 is full. The manager works in this
//! scale and the mechanism maps it to whatever the hardware wants (a PWM duty, an inverted duty, a
//! byte). Detecting "on external power" is deliberately the mechanism's problem, because it is
//! irreducibly per-board -- a VBUS pin on one, USB enumeration on another, a charger status line on
//! a third -- and the policy must never have to know which.
