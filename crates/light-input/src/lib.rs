//! Input: what the predecessor C framework split across separate touch and IMU modules. Gesture tracking
//! over a controller's samples (`touch`), the CST816T that produces them, the orientation model
//! (`imu`) and the QMI8658 behind it. Everything reaches hardware through
//! [`light_core::hal`]; the drivers' cadence rules were re-checked against mk4's loop rate
//! rather than copied, which is where the CST816T's minimum read gap came from.
