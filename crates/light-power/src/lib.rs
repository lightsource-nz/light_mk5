//! Power supply management, ported from the predecessor C framework with its hardest-won
//! property intact -- SAFE BY DEFAULT. Selecting a profile moves a real rail, and what hangs off
//! that rail is a fact about the board this layer cannot see. The failure is not theoretical and
//! not recoverable: on the board this was written against, the sink's output was hardwired to
//! a Pico's 5V input, and a single successful request for 9V would have ended the Pico. So a
//! device starts with its request ceiling at the USB-C default rail, and anything more is an
//! explicit decision made through [`Power::set_max_millivolts`] by whoever knows the wiring.
//!
//! The other lesson baked in: a selection is not a function call that succeeds or fails --
//! it is a message handed to a negotiation that answers later, or does not answer at all.
//! A HUSB238 was asked for 15V and for 20V, both advertised by the source; both writes
//! landed, both returned success, and the source granted neither. So the outcome is a
//! [`RequestState`] the poll path resolves, never a return value.
