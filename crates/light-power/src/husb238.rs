//! Hynetek HUSB238 USB Type-C Power Delivery SINK controller -- a "PD trigger": it
//! negotiates a contract with a USB-C source and hands the selected voltage to whatever is
//! downstream. It manages no rails of its own, which is why it is a [`PowerSource`] rather
//! than anything resembling a PMIC.
//!
//! PROVENANCE, because it changes how much the numbers below should be trusted: this map
//! comes from third-party libraries and a register-information sheet, NOT from a datasheet we
//! hold. Everything structural was confirmed against real hardware --
//! the address, the register file, and the per-voltage detect flags, which appeared on
//! exactly the five voltages a 45W charger offers and were clear on the 18V it does not.
//! The current-code table is corroborated arithmetically: it yields 45W at both 15V/3.0A
//! and 20V/2.25A independently, which a wrong table would not.
//!
//! The part is marked HUSB238; a board carrying one may read HUSB328 -- the same part with
//! the digits transposed.
//!
//! Every register is read and written ONE BYTE AT A TIME, and writes go through
//! [`I2cBus::write_register_byte`], the strictly framed two-byte transaction. Measurement
//! showed why that matters: a general write path sent the register address and payload as two
//! transfers separated by a repeated START, the chip acknowledged everything and stored
//! NOTHING -- SRC_PDO_SEL took five writes of five different values and read back 0x00 after
//! every one, so the negotiation appeared to do nothing while every return code said success.
