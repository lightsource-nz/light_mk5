//! The widget demo every touch board runs -- the APPLICATION, with no hardware in it.
//!
//! Three pages (toggles, a detail page, a scrolling list), driven by touch with swipe-back,
//! reorientable from an IMU, themed, and instrumented from the console. A tangible demo --
//! the 1.69, the 2.8, the 3.49 bar, the 4.0 square -- is a hardware-bound module that
//! constructs the concrete parts and owns everything this crate must not: pins, the display
//! driver and its quirks, the touch controller, board peripherals, the shell ABI, the panic
//! handler.
//!
//! The seams, in order of appearance:
//! - [`DemoEvent`] carries the demo's events plus a board EXTENSION type `X`, so board
//!   modules (audio, battery, PSRAM...) ride the same bus without this crate naming them.
//! - The event bus itself is a board static (its depth and subscriber count are board
//!   facts); it reaches the demo as `&'static dyn `[`Bus`].
//! - [`demo_pages!`] expands the page tree in the board crate, where the event type is
//!   concrete -- the board contributes only its title and touch-target metrics.
//! - [`DisplayMod`] is generic over the display driver, with a [`BoardHook`] for the
//!   driver-specific edges: GDDRAM offsets, panel clears, and any board command that needs
//!   the display or the UI (a bus re-clock, a test pattern).
//! - Every controller reports the one `light_input` touch [`TouchSample`], so touch needs
//!   no genericity at all.
